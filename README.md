# Document Content Extractor
The Document Content Extractor is a tool that can be used to extract semantic information from a pdf text file. This tool is useful when the structure and format of the text to be parsed in dynamic and the information to be extracted is semantic as opposed to syntactic in nature. It's not as fast as a static parser would be, but it can extract information that would be hard to encode in a static parser and does not need to be modified every time the format of the underlying document changes.

1. The tool leverages [OpenAI Completions Api](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/completions-api) to process the text.
2. It is fully configurable, refer to the section on `Fine tuning the adpater` below for more information.
3. the tool can be used both as a standalone python application or as a microservice running inside a larger application.
